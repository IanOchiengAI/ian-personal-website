# Agent Instructions - Ian Personal Website

> This project inherits from the master agent template at `..\.agent-template\AGENTS.md`

## Brand-Specific Configuration

This is the agent configuration for **Ian's Personal Website**.

### Inherited Architecture

- 3-Layer Architecture (Directive → Orchestration → Execution)
- Shared Skills (brand-extractor, brand-guidelines, frontend-design, skill-creator)
- Self-annealing error recovery

### Brand-Specific Customizations

Add brand-specific directives in `directives/` folder:

- Design preferences
- Color schemes
- Content requirements
- Deployment targets
